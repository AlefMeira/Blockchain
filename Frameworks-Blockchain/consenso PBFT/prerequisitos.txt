Architecture and Design

    To implement PBFT we will develop the following components:

    1.Wallet class — for public key and signing data.
    2.ansaction class — to create transactions and verify them.
    3.Block class — to create blocks, verify blocks and verify proposer of the block.
    4.Blockchain class — to create a chain, add blocks, calculate proposer, validate blocks, update blocks.
    5.P2p Server class — to broadcast and receive data among peers.
    6.Validators — to generate and verify validators
    7.Transaction pool, block pool, commit pool, prepare pool and message pool — to store transactions, blocks, commits, prepare and new round messages respectively.
    8.App — Express API to interact with the blockchain
    9.Config — to store global variables
    10.Chain Utilities — to store common functions such as hashing and verifying signatures.
